      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Flexibility</h4>
          <p>One of the primary benefits of E-Learning is the flexibility it offers. Students can access course materials and complete assignments on their own schedule, from anywhere in the world. This makes it possible for students to pursue their education while still working, caring for family members, or managing other responsibilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Convenience</h4>
          <p>E-Learning eliminates the need for students to travel to a physical classroom, which can save time and money. Students can complete coursework from the comfort of their own homes or wherever they have access to a computer and internet connection.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Customization</h4>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Lower Costs</h4>
